# Life events

This demo app can help you to keep track of different life and their durations.

It's more cool for bigger screen sizes than mobile, although it does work for mobile too.


## Get up and running

First, install `yarn` and `npm` if you don't have them installed already.


Then,

`yarn`

`yarn start`


The app is running on port 3000.
