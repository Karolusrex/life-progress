# Life events

This demo app can help you to keep track of different life episodes.

It works best for bigger screens, although it does work for mobile too.


## Get started

First, install `npm` and `node` if you don't have them installed already.


Then,

`npm install`

`npm run start`


The app should be running on port 3001.
